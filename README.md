# 06 Server-Side APIs: Jenny's Weather Dashboard

## Description

Using the Third - party API Open Weather Map I will retrieve a 5 day forecast using the parameter of a city. The weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Local storage will store persistent city searches.

## Usage

The user (a traveller) will use a form input to search for a city's weather forecast.
When they search for the city current and future conditions for that city will be displayed.
This city search will also dynamically be updated into the search history so the user can also click on the search history to display weather data instead of using the form input.
